# restaurants_covid
### Overview
This is a work in progress but here's an overview of the project.
A restaurant group wanted to gauge people's opinions towards to sit-down-dining during the COVID crisis and track any changes over time.
Decided to measure this with a survey asking people how often they dine in a sitdown restaurant and how often they expected to in the coming year. In June 2020 ran the initial survey. Followed up with a new survey in October 2020. 
## Notes
- The .py file will be updated regularly and the .ipynb will updated as notable key insights are discovered.
