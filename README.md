### Purpose
A restaurant group wanted to gauge people's opinions towards to sit-down-dining during the COVID crisis and track any changes over time.
Decided to measure this with a survey. Asked people how often they eat at a sitdown restaurant and how often they expected to in the coming year. In June 2020 ran the initial survey. Followed up with a new survey in October 2020. 
## Roadmap
- Look for demographics that may predict dining out.
